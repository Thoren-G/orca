# Forking this project

After forking a HOBBIT benchmark or system to create your own (version),
the following must be changed to avoid conflicts with the original project:

- URIs of RDF resources in the metadata file (`benchmark.ttl`) and in the code
- labels of RDF resources in the metadata file
- Docker image names
